# NSUT Connect

The Android/iOS **Expo mobile app** is in [mobile/](mobile/). See [mobile setup, offline storage, OAuth and push instructions](docs/MOBILE.md). The responsive web community demo and Express/PostgreSQL backend remain at the repository root.

Source in this repository is based on Pranay-learn/Crosslinks_Task at tree 5cea627d7aa6d8761e6ae596e12d03f24c8936f5. Crosslinks_Task remains unchanged. Deployment and native mobile additions are managed in Crosslinks_APPtask.

A responsive student community platform for NSUT, built with React, Vite, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, React Router, Lucide, and Framer Motion. Express, PostgreSQL, and Prisma back the default full-stack application.

Live mode requires real Google authentication with a verified `@nsut.ac.in` account. Student and administrator permissions are enforced on the server. If the API or OAuth configuration is unavailable, sign-in remains unavailable; simulated roles never grant campus access. This project is independent of official NSUT services.

## Getting started

Requires Node 24, npm, PostgreSQL 16+, and a Google OAuth web application. Run these commands in the extracted project or repository folder:

```sh
npm ci
```

Configure the database and Google credentials as described below, start the API, then run `npm run dev` in another terminal. The optional demo is a separate explicit command documented below.

The app includes:

- Personalized dashboard, campus feed, and working post creation, editing, deletion, likes, comments, private bookmarks, sharing, search, category filters, and following preferences.
- Discussions with tags, sorting, upvotes, detailed threads, nested replies, and author-controlled accepted answers.
- Announcements with priorities, pins, read status, detail pages, and administrator publication/archive controls.
- Responsive day/week timetables, batch filters, week navigation, campus time indicators, and conflict-checked administrator editing. Click a week-grid class to see its complete day view.
- Own-profile editing, student profiles, grouped global search, notifications, light/dark themes, and mobile navigation.
- Protected administration for notices, classes, moderation, account status, and audit history. Destructive actions require confirmation.
- Administrator-managed campus events with student RSVPs stored in PostgreSQL; students can remove their own RSVP and see aggregate attendance without attendee identities.

## Run the full-stack application

Use an existing PostgreSQL 16+ database, or start the optional local development database:

```sh
bash scripts/dev-db.sh
```

This helper creates or resumes `nsut-connect-db`, stores data in ignored `.local/postgres`, and binds its trust-authenticated development port exclusively to `127.0.0.1:5432`. It creates separate application and test databases. Use authenticated PostgreSQL for shared or production systems. The helper preserves existing data and refuses to start a container with a different data mount.

Create `.env` from `.env.example` if you do not already have one. Never overwrite existing credentials. Configure `DATABASE_URL` for your database, then:

```sh
npm run db:generate
npm run db:migrate
# Optional fictional seed; existing records are preserved.
SEED_DEMO_DATA=true npm run db:seed
npm run dev:server
```

In another terminal, start the frontend (live is the default):

```sh
npm run dev
```

Vite proxies `/api` to port 3001. `VITE_API_URL` may instead select a separately deployed API. Configure exact CORS origins on the server. Set `VITE_APP_MODE=live` in an existing `.env` that previously selected demo mode. Service or sign-in configuration failures show an unavailable message and a retry button, with no simulated login option in live mode.

For real sign-in, configure a Google OAuth web application with the exact callback `http://localhost:3001/api/auth/google/callback` in local development. Supply `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` and `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` securely through environment settings or an ignored local `.env`. The server verifies Google's identity and email status, requires the exact `@nsut.ac.in` domain, and uses HttpOnly sessions, CSRF protection, and server-side authorization. New accounts are students; an operator's `ADMIN_EMAILS` allowlist can grant administrator access. Never accept a role from the client.

Use an OAuth **web application client ID** ending in `.apps.googleusercontent.com`; a Google API key or project ID is not a client ID. The API checks the configured ID format before enabling sign-in. If running in a cloud or public deployment, register the reachable frontend/API origins and callback; a localhost callback points at the browser user's own computer.

Live Google consent/code exchange still requires validation with an actual campus account and a correctly registered callback. Automated security tests exercise the identity and authorization boundaries; trusted browser fixtures exercise real API/database sessions without bypassing production Google login.

Production requires HTTPS `CLIENT_ORIGIN` and `API_ORIGIN`, `NODE_ENV=production`, an authenticated database, real OAuth configuration, and the correct registered callback. Serve the built SPA with history fallback, and run the compiled API separately. Following preferences, community mutations, events, and RSVPs in live mode persist in PostgreSQL. Theme preferences remain local to the browser.

Google authentication does not connect a student's UMS account. Timetable APIs already include faculty and room names, but official UMS synchronization requires a supported authorized data source. The public UMS login URL alone supplies neither authenticated student data nor an API contract.

See [backend configuration and API documentation](docs/backend.md) for all variables, endpoints, privacy rules, and deployment considerations. Prisma uses its JavaScript query engine. The migration runner applies checked-in Prisma SQL transactionally with checksums and locks because Prisma 6.19's experimental JS migration deployment has a PostgreSQL catalog-type limitation. No TLS or artifact checks were disabled.

## Free hosting

Deploy the full-stack app to **Vercel Hobby + Neon Free** using the [deployment guide](docs/deploy-vercel.md). The checked-in Vercel configuration hosts the SPA and Express API on one HTTPS domain. Production builds use a direct database connection to apply migrations; previews skip migrations. Hosting accounts, a hosted database, and correctly registered Google OAuth credentials are required.

## Optional frontend demo

For an explicitly fictional experience without credentials or a database:

```sh
npm run dev:demo
```

Use **Student demo** or **Admin demo**. Google sign-in is simulated only in this separate demo. Sample notices, events, identities, and timetables are labeled fictional. Demo interactions and sessions persist in browser storage; role switching belongs to this mode only. Demo attendance is stored per simulated student. Logout removes the demo session while retaining community data; clearing site storage resets it.

## Validation

See [current verification boundaries](docs/VERIFICATION.md).

```sh
npm run typecheck
npm run lint
npm run build
# TEST_DATABASE_URL in .env enables real PostgreSQL API integration tests.
npm test
# Chromium defaults to /usr/bin/chromium; override CHROMIUM_PATH if needed.
npm run test:e2e
# Frontend against actual PostgreSQL/API, using isolated trusted test sessions.
npm run test:live
```

Database tests require the dedicated `nsut_connect_test` database and refuse to use the application's `DATABASE_URL`. Without `TEST_DATABASE_URL`, integration tests are reported as skipped. Browser tests run isolated demo sessions and exercise login/logout, navigation, persistence, post interactions, discussions, profiles, search, announcements, administration, mobile layouts, and themes. Unit and API tests cover ownership, authorization, non-campus identities, CSRF, session state, concurrency, notifications, migration repeatability, and timetable validation.

Each cloud task is already isolated. Use its existing checkout; do not create a worktree unless explicitly requested. Dependencies and generated files may be retained in the environment snapshot, but development servers and database processes must restart in a new task.
